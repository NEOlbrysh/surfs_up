## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to help W. Avy, a famous surfer and investor make important business decisions about opening an ice cream shop with surf gear, called "Surf n' Shake Shop" on the island of Oahu. The location is important because climate can vary on the island. W. Ivy wants to be prepared by knowing weather history and patterns in the area where the shop might be located. The data-driven decisions that we will make will be based on temperature and rainfall for 7 years from 2014-2021, specifically June and December. These 2 months are far apart enough to ensure we have good conditions year-round.




## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
-	The average temperature is in the 70's.
-	Both June and December showed similar min/max and average temperatures.
-	The assumption is that the temperature does not have dramatic fluctuations throughout the year.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
In summary, the temperature in Oahu is relatively the same throughout the year and the chance of continuous rainfall is low. When we rewrite the queries to add precipitation to the results for June and December, the average precipitation in those months showed:


-	June at 14%
-	December at 22%

Looking at the precipitation and the temperature proves that investing in Surf n' Shake is a good business venture and that Oahu, Hawaii is the ideal location.




The analysis focuses on the temperature and rainfall from six different weather stations.
The first box and whiskers chart show how the mild and steady temperatures are year-round. There is very little distribution of data and very few outliers.

The second box and whiskers chart are impacted by the outliers. 
The next Data Frame Summaries represent the AVERAGE Precipitation for both June and December and begin to give us a clearer picture.

The next Line Chart gives us a better idea of seasonal precipitation for both June and December. We can conclude from this compilation of summaries and charts, there was a year in 2014 where above average rainfall did occur, but after that timeframe, precipitation leveled out and was very consistent in the years 2015-2021.
